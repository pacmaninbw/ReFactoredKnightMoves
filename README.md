# ReFactoredKnightMoves
Recursive Breadth First Search implementing a modified Knights Tour in C++11

## Environment
This program was developed on CentOS 7.2 using eclipse. The makefile was developed to run outside the Eclipse environment
so that it could be ported to different platforms. It has been run/tested on 2 different CentOS 7.2 platforms with different
amounts of memory, Window 10 Pro using Visual Studio 2015 and a MacBook Pro running El Capitan and Xcode 8.2.

No changes to the code were necessary to run on the alternate platforms.
